# :computer: Tech ins :computer:

## What are tech ins?

Tech ins are an opportunity to have a chat with a facilitator 1:1 on how your technical learning is going. We will ask you some questions on some of the following topics:

- What is your problem-solving process?
- How have you found pair-programming?
- Are there any assessments or challenges you need help with or are behind on?

Bring any other questions or blocks you have to the tech in as well!

## How often will they happen?

At a minimum, tech ins will happen once in Phase One (weeks one to three) and once in Phase Two (weeks four to six). Your assigned facilitator will schedule a time with you, but also feel free to request a specific time with your facilitator.

If you would like a tech in at any other time, you are welcome to book a time with any of the facilitators. 

## Do I have to have a tech in?

Ideally yes. It's a good opportunity to talk through any issues you are having, or to just have a chat about tech things you would like to work on. It also great for facilitators to get a better idea on how everyone is getting on.

## Who will I have a tech in with?

We will assign you a facilitator to have a tech in with, and you will have a different facilitator each time. 

The facilitator you have a tech in with will probably be different to your Trello assessment facilitator, but still feel free to talk about assessments during your tech in.
